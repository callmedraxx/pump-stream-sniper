"""
Lightweight in-process event broadcaster for notifying components (SSE, websockets) about events.
This avoids polling and lets DatabaseSyncService publish sync events that the SSE generator can await.

Usage:
    from src.services.event_broadcaster import broadcaster
    await broadcaster.publish('sync_completed', payload)
    await broadcaster.subscribe('sync_completed', callback)

The callback will be called with the payload (can be sync stats dict).

This broadcaster is intentionally simple and runs in-process; it does not persist events.
